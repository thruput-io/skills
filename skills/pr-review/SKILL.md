name: pr-review
description: Reviews a GitHub or Azure DevOps Pull Request against the thruput-io handbook rules and posts the review as inline comments on the correct lines. Distinct from the built-in `/review` skill in that it (a) follows the handbook at `github.com/thruput-io/handbook` (specifically `CODE_REVIEW.md`), (b) probes every rule in its own subagent, and (c) groups all inline comments into one review where the host allows it, rather than posting N individual comments. Trigger when the user provides a PR URL or asks for a handbook-driven PR review.

# PR Review Skill

Read [`CODE_REVIEW.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thruput-io/handbook/main/CODE_REVIEW.md) and follow it. It is the source of truth for both what to review
and how to execute the review via the `gh` CLI. Read the current version rather than a cached copy.

It dispatches one subagent per probe using [`PROBE_SUBAGENT_TEMPLATE.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thruput-io/handbook/main/PROBE_SUBAGENT_TEMPLATE.md); read that when you
reach [`CODE_REVIEW.md` step 3](https://github.com/thruput-io/handbook/blob/main/CODE_REVIEW.md#3-library-search-and-rule-evaluation-run-in-parallel).

The escalation index named by [`CODE_REVIEW.md` step 4](https://github.com/thruput-io/handbook/blob/main/CODE_REVIEW.md#4-escalate-when-the-ledger-comes-back-clean) is bundled under `references/` so it is available
without the handbook checkout. Use the bundled copy; the step's own instructions for reading
through it to the source repository still apply.

Exact commands and payload shapes are not in `CODE_REVIEW.md` — they are in the cheat sheet for the
host the PR lives on: [`gh-cheat-sheet.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thruput-io/handbook/main/gh-cheat-sheet.md) for GitHub, [`az-cheat-sheet.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thruput-io/handbook/main/az-cheat-sheet.md) for Azure DevOps
(`dev.azure.com`). Read the one that matches the PR URL.

## Requirements

- For a GitHub PR: `gh` CLI available.
- For an Azure DevOps PR: `az` CLI with the `azure-devops` extension available.
- Access to `github.com/thruput-io/handbook`.
- Network access to `github.com/ciembor/agent-rules-books` for the step 4 escalation pass.

## Files

- `references/agent-rules-books-INDEX.md`, `references/agent-rules-books-search-index.json` —
  escalation index, byte-for-byte mirrors of the handbook's `references/`. Refresh with:

      for f in agent-rules-books-INDEX.md agent-rules-books-search-index.json; do
        gh api "repos/thruput-io/handbook/contents/references/$f" --jq '.content' | base64 -d > "references/$f"
      done
